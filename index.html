        <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Simplicity and accessibility: HTML was created as a simple language that allows for the rapid creation and sharing of documents online. It's easy to learn, making it ideal for beginners.</li>
        <li>Structure over style: HTML defines what's on a page: headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and links. It provides a framework, but doesn't determine how these elements appear.</li>
        <li>Foundation for Development: Although more complex technologies exist today, HTML remains the fundamental language. Understanding HTML is essential for learning other languages ​​and frameworks, such as JavaScript and React.</li>   
    </ul>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Born out of necessity: CSS was created to solve the problem of website design being limited by HTML. The idea was to separate content and design, making web pages easier to develop and maintain.</li>
        <li>Separating design from content: With CSS, developers can change the appearance of elements without changing the HTML itself. For example, they can change the text color or font size without rewriting the HTML code.</li>
        <li>Responsibility for appearance: If HTML is the skeleton of a web page, then CSS is the "clothing" that gives it style, colors, fonts, and layout. It makes websites attractive and user-friendly.</li>
